# node-readability
[Readability.js by Arc90](http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/) ported to node.js.

Blog post: [Server side readability with node.js](http://arrix.blogspot.com/2010/11/server-side-readability-with-nodejs.html)
## Requirements
* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom)
* [htmlparser](https://github.com/tautologistics/node-htmlparser)

## Live demo
I'm working on it...
## Example

    var readability = require('node-readability');
    //...
    // This is an very early example. The API is subject to change.
    readability.parse(html, url, function(result) {
        console.log(result.title, result.content);
    });

## Performance
In my testing of 140 pages with an average size of **58KB** collected from [digg](http://digg.com/news.rss), [delicious](http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/?count=50) and [hacker news](http://news.ycombinator.com/rss), the average time taken for each page is about **1.1 seconds** on a Mac Mini (2.4G Intel Core 2 Duo).
## Limitation
* no fetching next pages
* no support for frames

## Plan
* Performance optimization
* Better API, more options
* Support more readability features
